  <p>This is a simple Angular home page with a header and footer. Below are some interesting facts about Angular!</p>

  <section class="facts">
    <h2>Why Angular?</h2>
    <p>Angular is a powerful and popular front-end framework developed and maintained by Google. It is used to build dynamic, single-page web applications with rich functionality. Here are some key features of Angular:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Two-way data binding:</strong> Angular allows you to sync data between the model and view automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Component-based architecture:</strong> Angular's component-based approach helps create reusable UI components, making code easy to manage and scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Directives:</strong> Angular provides built-in directives (like <code>ngIf</code>, <code>ngFor</code>) to extend HTML capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency Injection (DI):</strong> Angular's DI system improves code modularity, making it easier to manage services and business logic.</li>
      <li><strong>RxJS:</strong> Angular leverages RxJS for handling asynchronous programming and event-based data streams.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Modular Development</h3>
        <p>Angularâ€™s modularity helps developers manage different functionalities as independent units of code, enhancing scalability and maintainability.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>Cross-platform Development</h3>
        <p>With Angular, you can build applications for web, mobile, and desktop from a single codebase.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-box">
        <h3>TypeScript Integration</h3>
        <p>Angular is built with TypeScript, offering strong typing, interfaces, and modern JavaScript features that improve the development experience.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Angular Lifecycle Hooks</h2>
    <p>Angular components have lifecycle hooks that allow developers to tap into specific moments in a component's lifecycle, such as initialization, change detection, and destruction.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>ngOnInit:</strong> Called after the component's data-bound properties are initialized.</li>
      <li><strong>ngOnChanges:</strong> Invoked whenever there are changes to input-bound properties.</li>
      <li><strong>ngOnDestroy:</strong> Called just before a component is destroyed.</li>
      <li><strong>ngDoCheck:</strong> Allows you to check and respond to changes that Angular can't or doesn't detect.</li>
    </ul>
